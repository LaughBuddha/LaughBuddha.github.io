Graduate student at **University of Pennsylvania**, [MSE in Data Science](https://dats.seas.upenn.edu/) (Dec, 2021)

### Areas of Interest
Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning

### Research
Completed Masters thesis in [Navigation To Multiple Semantic Targets In Novel Indoor Environments](https://github.com/LaughBuddha/LaughBuddha.github.io/blob/master/SiddharthGoel_Masters_ThesisCGKD.pdf)

**Keywords** - *Multi-object Navigation, Visual Navigation, Object-goal Navigation*<br/>
**Advised by** - [Kostas Daniilidis](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~kostas/), [Georgios Georgakis](https://cs.gmu.edu/~ggeorgak/), and [Bernadette Bucher
](https://bucherb.github.io/)

* [Optimized semantic map prediction in Learning2Map (L2M) algorithm for indoor navigation](https://github.com/LaughBuddha/Object-Goal-Navigation/blob/main/Learning2Map_LSTM_FocalLoss.pdf) | *Pytorch, Python*
   - Explored the various sub-components (map prediction, goal selection, navigation) of training an autonomous agent to navigate to different objects in an indoor environment.
   - Improved IoU and F1 score metrics by changing the loss function with Focal Loss, incorporating an LSTM layer in the network, and fine-tuning the weights for different components of the loss objective.
   - Experiments performed using [Matterport3D dataset](https://niessner.github.io/Matterport/) on [AI Habitat](https://aihabitat.org/) simulator.

### Summer Internship (May - Aug, 2021) @ <img align="center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18654826/120942319-093d0c80-c6dd-11eb-8c37-1bfdcaf938f2.png" width="100" height="30"> 
* **Forward Looking Sampling** | *Python, SQL, Amazon Sagemaker, S3*
   - As an **Applied Scientist Intern** on the **Supply Chain Optimization Technologies (SCOT) - Fulfillment Optimization (FO)** team. 
   - Designed and evaluated a novel forward-looking sampling strategy to generate high-fidelity samples of the millions of customer orders placed on Amazon.com and its subsidiaries.
   - Performed K-means clustering to incorporate demand forecast and produce samples which are representative of future demand, leading to better planning and execution of resources for peak periods (Prime Day, Black Friday, Christmas and New Years etc.).
   - The samples are used to run simulations based on which Amazon plans its entire order fulfillment supply chain across the world.

### Projects
* **US Traffic Accidents** | *Predictive Analytics, Python, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, Spark* | [Github Repo](https://github.com/LaughBuddha/Predictive-Analytics/blob/master/US_Traffic_Accidents.ipynb)
    - Built the complete data science pipeline by performing extensive exploratory data analysis, data pre-processing, feature engineering, and data modelling on about 3 million records of the [US Traffic Accidents dataset](https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us_accidents).

* **Audio Source Separation** | *Deep Learning, PyTorch, Python* | [Github Repo](https://github.com/LaughBuddha/Audio-Source-Separation)
    - Separated [MUSDB18](https://sigsep.github.io/datasets/musdb.html#musdb18-compressed-stems) dataset mixture tracks into vocals, drums, bass, and other instruments using LSTM and state-of-the-art deep learning models.
