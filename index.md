### Research
Pursuing master's thesis in **Computer Vision/Perception in Robotics**

**Topic** - Navigation of agents in 3D indoor environments to achieve tasks such as point goal, object goal, and multi-object navigation.<br/>
**Advised by** - [Kostas Daniilidis](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~kostas/) and [Georgios Georgakis](https://cs.gmu.edu/~ggeorgak/)

Currently, my research is in very initial stages. To get an idea of the problem statement please refer the following related works - [Active Neural SLAM](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dchaplot/projects/neural-slam.html) and [Semantic Exploration](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dchaplot/projects/semantic-exploration.html) by Chaplot et al., [Multi-Object Navigation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.03912.pdf) by Wani et al. and [AI Habitat](https://aihabitat.org/).

Personal contributions to be updated soon. [Last Updated: Feb 01, 2021]

### Projects
* **US Traffic Accidents** | *Predictive Analytics, Python, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, Spark* | [Github Repo](https://github.com/LaughBuddha/Predictive-Analytics/blob/master/US_Traffic_Accidents.ipynb)
    - Built the complete data science pipeline by performing extensive exploratory data analysis, data pre-processing, feature engineering, and data modelling on about 3 million records of the [US Traffic Accidents dataset](https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us_accidents).

* **Audio Source Separation** | *Deep Learning, PyTorch, Python* | [Github Repo](https://github.com/LaughBuddha/Audio-Source-Separation)
    - Separated [MUSDB18](https://sigsep.github.io/datasets/musdb.html#musdb18-compressed-stems) dataset mixture tracks into vocals, drums, bass, and other instruments using LSTM and state-of-the-art deep learning models.
